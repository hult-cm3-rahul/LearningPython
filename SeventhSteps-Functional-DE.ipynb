    "So what is the overarching story here? By modularizing summation as a combination of a “higher-order function” and an operator, we have arrived at a part (f_op) that can be used to write many other functions on lists with no more programming effort. And then we used it and a function that returns a function, which as can be seen implements a composition of functions, to arrive at a simple `map` which takes every element and does something to it, implemented in terms of `f_op`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize, a higher-order-function: a function that calls a function and can return a function combines with a specializing function like `double` to make writing more complex programs easy. And because these functions are pure, we can move around their execution, to different points in time, but also to different machines, and if something goes wrong, we just have to do the function again.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize this to other data structures like trees, we'll have to write `foldtree` and `maptree`, general ways of visiting that data structure. And combine with specializing functions in the same way. These constructs lead to easy parallelization, and thus we get map-reduce from google and its successor Hadoop."
